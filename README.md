myJavaEncryptionPractice
========================

Practice project to get used to Eclipse and git.

Dear reader, please note:

After 14 years of inhouse software development with my company's very own, very powerful and very proprietary tools,
programming language and project methodology, I am now moving back to public tools (Eclipse, git), languages (C++,
Java, JavaScript) and processes.

Therefore I created a few tiny repositories, including this one, to hone my skills and get up to speed to the
nitty-gritty details of aforementioned tools such as Eclipse and git.

Don't take these encryption projects seriously.

Thanks and kind regards, Joerg
